# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: Debugging Challenges

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the Expo CLI produces a vague "Command failed" error, making debugging difficult.  The error lacks specific details, requiring systematic investigation of potential causes.

## Problem

The Expo CLI throws an error without providing enough information to pinpoint the issue. This is different from common Expo errors which typically provide clearer guidance. This is often caused by issues within the project setup rather than bugs within Expo itself.

## Solution

The provided solution (`bugSolution.js`) offers strategies for debugging this type of error, including:

- Verifying `package.json` and `app.json`/`expo.json` for correctness
- Checking the project directory structure for inconsistencies
- Examining environment variables for conflicts
- Ensuring Node.js and npm (or yarn) are up-to-date
- Trying a clean installation of project dependencies
- Comparing against a known-good Expo project setup

This repo serves as a reference for others encountering this elusive problem.
