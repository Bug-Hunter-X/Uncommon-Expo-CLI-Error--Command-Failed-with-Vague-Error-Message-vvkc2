This error typically arises when Expo CLI is unable to locate or correctly interpret the necessary configuration files or dependencies within your project.  It might stem from problems with your `package.json`, `app.json` (or `expo.json`), or even issues with your project's directory structure.  Incorrectly configured environment variables can also trigger this. The error message itself is often vague, making diagnosis challenging.  You might see variations like `Error: Command failed: ...` with a long stack trace that doesn't pinpoint the root cause directly.
